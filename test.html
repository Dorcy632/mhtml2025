<p style="color: black">Nature is life and is always important.Be it animal or human life.
Nature is everything.The fresh air,water and everything plays a vital role in our lives
  What humans have to do is ensure that the environment is always and forever conserved.
  they should ensure that their environs are always clean and conducive.When trees are cut,
  others should be planted to make the area anaesthetic</p>
